Explanation of the Code
Definition and Initialization:

The program starts by defining an array, videoDuration, containing the durations of individual videos in seconds.

int[] videoDuration = {240, 180, 210, 300, 150, 270};
Calculating Total Playlist Length:

The method calculateTotalLength(int[] durations) takes the array of video durations as input.
A for loop iterates through the array, summing up all durations into a variable totalDuration.

public static int calculateTotalLength(int[] durations) {
    int totalDuration = 0;
    for (int duration : durations) {
        totalDuration += duration;
    }
    return totalDuration;
}
Conversion of Total Duration:

The total duration (in seconds) is converted into a more user-friendly format (hours, minutes, and seconds):
Hours: totalLengthInSeconds / 3600
Minutes: (totalLengthInSeconds % 3600) / 60
Seconds: totalLengthInSeconds % 60

int hours = totalLengthInSeconds / 3600;
int minutes = (totalLengthInSeconds % 3600) / 60;
int seconds = totalLengthInSeconds % 60;
Output:

The formatted playlist length is printed to the console:

System.out.println("Total Playlist Length: " + hours + " hours, " + minutes + " minutes, " + seconds + " seconds");
